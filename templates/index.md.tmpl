# CANCOM Provider

The CANCOM provider is used to interact with the CANCOM Cloud.

To use this provider, you need an active subscription to [CANCOM Marketplace] (https://marketplace.cancom.de/de/home).
Currently, signup is restricted to certain customers, but we plan to open signup to a broader audience soon.

You can reach the CANCOM Cloud here: [https://portal.cancom.io](https://portal.cancom.io)

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider_configuration.tf" }}

## Authentication

The CANCOM provider can be configured over the following token sources:

* Parameters in the provider configuration
* Environment variables

### Environment Variables

You can provide your API token via `CANCOM_TOKEN` environment variable, representing your CANCOM token.
When using this method, you may omit the CANCOM provider block entirely.
If both `token` and `CANCOM_TOKEN` is set, `token` will be used.

Usage:

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/index-env-var-tf-plan.txt" }}

### Context

By default, the terraform is executed in the context of the current principle identified by the token. If you need to change context, you can also provide the `role` parameter to assume a role in a different tenant. In this case, all actions are executed within the context of the assumed role.
