## Schema

### Required

- `policy` (Block List, Min: 1) You can choose either a profile or a custom policy.   
This block allows to setup policies using predefined profiles (`policy.profile`). Profile can either be `full-access` or `reader`, providing either administrative access to the service, or read-only access.  
If you want to manage policies on a find-grained basis, you can use `policy.custom` instead.

~> **Note:** `profile` and `custom` are not joined into a single policy. If both are provided, `custom` is preferred over `profile`, and `profile` will be ignored.

~> **Note:** Either `profile` or `custom` must be provided. Otherwise, this resource will fail.

. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policy))
- `principal` (String) The principal that the policy should be applied to. Can be applied to Users, ServiceUsers, and Roles.
- `service` (String) The service name to provide permissions for.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `policy`

Optional:

- `custom` (Map of String) Provide a customized policy. If `custom` is set, it is preferred over `profile`
- `profile` (String) Can be set to `reader`, or `full-access`. Applies either reader or administrative access to the service.
